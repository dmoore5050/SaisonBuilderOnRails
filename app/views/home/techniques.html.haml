  %p.text_block <b>Secondary fermentation</b> - extendedfermentation of a beer that occurs after primary fermentation is either complete or nearly complete. The beer is transferred from the primary fermenter to a new fermentation vessel that has been sanitized and preferaly purged of oxygen. Secondary fermentation is often associated with aging of the beer on specialized ingredients, such as fruit, add'l hops (see <b>Dryhopping</b>), coffee, cocoa, spices, wood, or botanicals.<br>
  <span class='text_block'> Secondary fermentation is sometimes used for the addition of a supplementary yeast, most often one differing from the one used for primary fermentation. In these cases, the beer is transferred to secondary and both a new yeast(in many cases, this new yeast will be Brettanomyces), and a source of fermentable for the new yeast to consume (fruit, sugar,etc.).</span>

  %p.text_block <b>Dryhopping</b> - extended aging of a post- primary-fermentation beer on whole or pelletized hops. Generally, this occurs in either a secondary fermentation vessel or in a keg. Hops are either placed in a sanitized fine strainer bag and weighted with sanitized weights (if pellets) or added directly to the secondary fermentation vessel (if whole). Because hops are naturally anti-microbial, there is no need to sanitize the hops themselves before adding them.
